        <h1>Wellness Topics</h1>
        <p>Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis to attain better physical and mental health outcomes, so that instead of just surviving, you’re thriving.
            <br>To understand the significance of wellness, it’s important to understand how it's linked to health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as being <br> “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” - <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/health-wellness/wellness/what-is-wellness" target="_blank">Pfizer</a></p>

                <h2>Meditation</h2>
                <p>Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object,thought, or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.</p>

            <div class="wellness-box">
                <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
                <p>Mindfulness is a type of meditation in which you focus on being intensely aware of what you're sensing and feeling in the moment, without interpretation or judgment. Practicing mindfulness involves breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wellness-box">
                <h2>Yoga</h2>
                <p>Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. It is an art and science of healthy living. The word 'Yoga' is derived from the Sanskrit root 'Yuj', meaning 'to join' or 'to yoke' or 'to unite'.</p>
