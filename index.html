        <h1>Wellness Topics</h1>
        <p>Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis to attain better physical and mental health outcomes, so that instead of just surviving, you’re thriving.
            <br>To understand the significance of wellness, it’s important to understand how it's linked to health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as being <br> “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” - <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/health-wellness/wellness/what-is-wellness" target="_blank">Pfizer</a></p>
